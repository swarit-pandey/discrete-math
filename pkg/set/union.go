// Theorem: Associativity of Union Operation
// The union operation is associative, i.e., (A U B) U C = A U (B U C).
// This property allows us to compute the union of a collection of sets in a divide-and-conquer manner.
// We can recursively divide the collection into smaller subsets, compute their unions, and combine these results,
// ensuring the correctness of the final union irrespective of the order in which individual unions are performed.
